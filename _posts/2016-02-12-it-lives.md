Through this venue we shall inform the populace about the imminent global phenomenon that is Stardazed,
an in-development web 3D game library written in TypeScript.

Wellâ€¦, I like it at least.

If you're into code, [have a look][repo] at the code on github.<br>

If playing games is more your thing then play my [Ludum Dare][ld] entry I made using SD:<br>
[Snowman Builder Extreme][sbe].
It's a game jam game made in 3 days but it's still pretty decent, also try it on your phone!

More info coming up, stay determined.

(updated Jan 2018, changed the URLs and project name from SDTX to SD)
