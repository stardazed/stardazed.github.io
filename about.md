Stardazed is a library to enable quick development of custom 3D games in the browser.

The project status is currently: In Development (Pre-Alpha)<br>
Features and APIs are still very much in flux, but it is functional and usable for actual development (I'm using it for prototypes and Game Jams).

### Goals

_"A small but powerful alternative for tools like Unity for 3D browser games"_

There is still quite a ways to go for this to become a reality, but I've already used the library succesfully for small projects.
For the foreseeable future the library will require medium to high technical expertise to use.

For more information have a look at [the repository](https://github.com/stardazed/stardazed).
