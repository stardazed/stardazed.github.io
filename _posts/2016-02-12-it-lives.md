Through this venue we shall inform the frantic populace about the imminent global phenomenon that is Stardazed TX,
an in-development web 3D game library written in TypeScript.

Wellâ€¦, I like it at least.

If you're into code, [have a look][repo] at the code on github.<br>

If playing games is more your thing then play my [Ludum Dare][ld] entry I made using SDTX:<br>
[Snowman Builder Extreme][sbe].
It's a game jam game made in 3 days but it's still pretty decent, also try it on your phone!

More info coming up, stay determined.
